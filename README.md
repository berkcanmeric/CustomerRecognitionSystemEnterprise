CafeHub

CafeHub is a mobile and web application that helps users find and review cafes. The app allows users to browse nearby cafes, view their menus, and read reviews from other users. Users can also leave their own reviews and ratings, and interact with other customers at the cafes through the mobile app.

Technologies Used

For the mobile app, we used Kotlin and Firebase for authentication, database, hosting, and AI. For the web app, we used ASP.NET Core, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Firebase, and AI.
